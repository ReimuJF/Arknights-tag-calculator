Example how tool works https://youtu.be/8_ryN5lEcsk

I used microsoft windows tool "Scissors" (win+shift+S - hotkey) it place chosen screen area to buffer. 

I added tag combination manualy (can miss something)
Tool doesnt look up for single tag such as nuker, fast-redeploy, speacialist (and 4* coombination with them) etc. implying you know that tags guarantee 4* or 5* star
